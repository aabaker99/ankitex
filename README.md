# Anki

[Anki](http://ankisrs.net/) is a flashcard software that uses [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition).
I like it because it supports LaTeX, which makes it easy to make flashcards with math formulas, definitions, and theorems that you want to remember.
This repository contains some simple functions and scripts for transforming specifically-structured LaTeX files into flashcards that can be imported into Anki.
